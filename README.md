# Library Database Management and Query System

## Project Overview

A structured Library Database system built using SQL that tracks books, members, and loans to support library operations and provide meaningful insights through SQL queries.

## Goal

To design, build, and query a structured Library Database using SQL only. The system efficiently tracks books, members, and loan activities.

## Core Entities

· Books – Details of all available books in the library
· Members – Registered members who can borrow books
· Loans – Records of book borrow and return activities

##Project Phases

### Database Setup

Objective: Create a new database and prepare it for schema design
· Create the main library database
· Verify database connection and activation

 ### Database Tables and Schema Design

Objective: Define the structure of the library system using tables and relationships
· Books Table
· Members Table
· Loans Table
Validation and Inspection:
· Check structure of all tables
· Verify table relationships

### Writing Basic SQL Queries

Objective: Learn to extract and filter data from your tables
· View all books in the collection
· Show all registered members
· Find loans made on specific dates
· Display books with high availability

### Applying Comparison and Logical Operators

Objective: Use operators to build complex conditions and extract analytical insights
· Filter books by publication year
· Identify members by join date
· Categorize books by genre
· Track outstanding loans
· Analyze member borrowing patterns

###  Sorting, Filtering, and Limiting Result
Objective: Organize, paginate, and refine your query results
· Sort books alphabetically
· List unique book genres
· Display recent members with pagination
· Show latest active loans
· Implement result limiting and offset
